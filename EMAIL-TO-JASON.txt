Subject: Your Website is Ready (Finally!) - Just Need Your Content

Hey Jason,

First off, sorry it took me a while to get started on this. But the good news is the website is looking really good now and I think you're going to love it.

I've attached a video so you can see how it looks right now. I've got the whole thing built and ready to go – just need your actual content to replace all my placeholder text. Here's what I need from you:

Photos:
- A good professional headshot
- A couple photos of you with patients, at your practice, or from graduation
- Photos from your charity work (one for each project you want on the site)

Your Info:
- Full credentials and specialty
- Where you went to med school and did residency
- Board certifications
- Career highlights and how long you've been practicing

Biography:
- Just tell me your story – how you got into medicine, your approach to patient care, achievements, whatever you want people to know
- A few paragraphs is perfect, doesn't need to be fancy. I'll make it sound good

Contact:
- Phone number for the site
- Email address you want displayed

Charity Projects:
For each donation you want featured:
- What it was, when it happened
- Who it helped
- What difference it made

Also:
- What domain name do you want? (jasonjamesmedicine.com, drjasonjames.com, etc.)
- Any color preferences or is the current blue theme good?

And hey, if you don't want certain sections, want fewer pictures, or want to change anything about the layout – just let me know. I'm more than happy to adjust whatever you need.

Just send everything however – email, text, voice notes, scribbled on napkins, whatever works. I'll handle making it all look professional on the site.

Let me know when you can get this to me and we'll have you live soon!

Victor
