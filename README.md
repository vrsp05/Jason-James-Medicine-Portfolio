# Dr. Jason James Portfolio

A professional, heartfelt website portfolio created for Dr. Jason James, my father-in-law. This project showcases his dedication to medicine, his work as an internal medicine hospitalist, and his incredible charitable impact across multiple countries.

This was a fun and meaningful project to work on - combining my technical skills with the opportunity to honor someone who truly makes a difference in people's lives.

3. ✅ **Bio refinements** - Replaced placeholder text with real information about Dr. James
4. ✅ **Impact page** - Updated with specific hospital names and locations
5. ✅ **Contact details** - Added real phone and email information

Special thanks to **GitHub Copilot** for helping bring this vision to life efficiently and thoughtfully!
